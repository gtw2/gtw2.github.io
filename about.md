	<h1 class="pageTitle">About Mark</h1>
	<p>I'm a PhD candidate in the <a href="http://arfc.github.io">Advanced Reactor and Fuel Cycle</a> group at the <a href="https://npre.illinois.edu/">Department of Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://illinois.edu/">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>. My research focuses on applying machine learning to pattern recognition problems in nuclear security and nuclear treaty verification. As a part of my research, I am developing <a href="https://github.com/kamuda1/annsa">annsa</a>, a Python package for quick gamma-ray spectroscopy datasets prototyping and deep learning using TensorFlow. My interests include advances in deep learning and generative art.
