	<h1 class="pageTitle">About Greg</h1>
    <font size="4">
	<p>I'm a Master's Student in the <a href="http://arfc.github.io">Advanced Reactor and Fuel Cycle</a> group at the <a href="https://npre.illinois.edu/">Department of Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://illinois.edu/">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>. My research focuses on pyroprocessing diversion scenarios in the <a href="fuelcycle.org">Cyclus</a> fuel cycle simulator. As a part of my research, I am developing <a href="https://github.com/cyclus/recycle">Pyre</a>, a pyroprocessing module for Cyclus to simulate a variety of pyroprocessing plant configurations. My interests include non-proliferation, fuel reprocessing and software development.
